# 🌍 World Simulator: Earth's Geological Evolution

> **Pursuing the most accurate crop simulations at a global scale through comprehensive Earth system modeling**

## 🎯 Mission Statement

This project aims to recreate Earth's geological evolution from core formation to present-day soil composition, enabling unprecedented accuracy in global crop and ecosystem simulations. By modeling the complete Earth system - from inner core dynamics to surface soil formation - we can predict both historical events and future outcomes with remarkable precision.

## 🌱 Vision

**The most accurate crop simulations at a global scale that anyone has seen.**

We believe that by recreating the fundamental composition and processes of Earth itself, we can achieve the most accurate predictions of:
- Historical soil formation and composition
- Future vegetation patterns and crop yields
- Ecosystem responses to geological changes
- Climate-vegetation-geology interactions

## 🔬 Scientific Approach

### Multi-Layer Earth System Modeling

Our simulator recreates Earth's complete structure:

#### 🌋 **Core System**
- **Inner Core**: Iron-nickel crystallization, magnetic field generation
- **Outer Core**: Convective dynamics, heat transfer to mantle
- **Magnetic Field**: Geodynamo effects on surface processes

#### 🌊 **Mantle System**
- **Lithosphere**: Rigid outer shell, tectonic plate formation
- **Asthenosphere**: Plastic deformation, plate movement
- **Transition Zone**: Phase changes, water storage
- **Lower Mantle**: Deep convection, slab recycling
- **D'' Layer**: Ultra-low velocity zone, plume generation

#### 🏔️ **Crust & Surface**
- **Continental Crust**: Granite-dominated, thick, stable
- **Oceanic Crust**: Basalt-dominated, thin, dynamic
- **Tectonic Plates**: Movement, collision, subduction
- **Hot Spots**: Volcanic activity, island formation

#### 🌱 **Soil Formation Process**
- **Weathering**: Rock breakdown by climate and time
- **Erosion**: Transport of materials by water and wind
- **Deposition**: Accumulation of sediments
- **Biological Activity**: Organic matter incorporation
- **Mineral Transformation**: Chemical and physical changes
